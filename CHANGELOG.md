## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Initial release: `Carve.to_html` exposes the carve-rs engine as a native
  Ruby extension (magnus + rb-sys), with the full extension/option surface,
  the static/print render mode, and pluggable diagram/math renderers.
- `Carve.parse` returns the full parse tree as symbol-keyed Ruby Hashes and
  Arrays (every AST node type is covered), enabling custom renderers such as
  [carve-hexapdf](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-hexapdf).
